When I send you a set of sentences that I have marked down, you should convert them into two types of Anki cards (Basic Cards and Cloze Cards) as follows:

### Basic Cards
There are two formats for creating Basic Cards:

1. **Phrase-based Card**:
   ```markdown
   ## Phrase: "..."
   %
   **Explanation**: ...
   **Complete sentence**: "..."
   ```

2. **Scene-based Card**:
   ```markdown
   ## Scene prompt: ...
   %
   **Complete sentence**: "..."
   **Explanation**: ...
   ```

**Example of Basic Cards**:
```markdown
# Expressions in Friends - Basic Cards

## Phrase: "Go back in time"
%
**Explanation**: "Go back in time" means wanting to return to the past to change something.
**Complete sentence**: "Go back in time and listen to Phoebe."

## Scene prompt: Ross addresses Rachel's mistake
%
**Complete sentence**: "Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this."
**Explanation**: Used to show someone is aware of making a mistake.
```

### Cloze Cards
There is one format for creating Cloze Cards. 

If a sentence is not formatted into any specific card type, this indicates I understand its meaning but need to learn how it is constructed. In this case, convert it into a cloze card by selecting words based on the following criteria:

#### Criteria for Choosing Words to Cloze:
- **Key Verbs and Phrases**: Essential for understanding the main action or state.
- **Unique or Important Vocabulary**: Enhances vocabulary retention.
- **Idiomatic or Colloquial Expressions**: Reinforces learning of natural language use.
- **Structural Components**: Helps with understanding sentence construction.
- **Context-specific Details**: Provides necessary context for the sentence.

**Example of a Cloze Card**:
```markdown
## Fill in the blank
**Hint**: verb related to movement
"The clock is {{c1::ticking}}, and the race for the White House is {{c2::heating up}}."
%
**Explanation**: "Ticking" indicates the passage of time, and "heating up" shows increasing intensity.
```

### Additional Rules:
- When a sentence contains words in **bold**, those words must be explained in the **Explanation** section.
- If a sentence is not marked for specific words, apply the cloze criteria to create cloze deletions for key words or phrases.
- **Ensure every sentence is converted**: If a sentence does not fit into the specific card formats outlined above, create a basic card with a general explanation.
- **Fallback Rule**: For any sentence that poses a challenge, create a scene-based card that explains its overall importance.

### Instructions:
- Convert the sentences I provide into the formats above.
- Send me back the Basic Cards and Cloze Cards separately.
- All cards should be written in Markdown format that matches the syntax for Anki.
- Ensure all words marked in **bold** are explained in the **Explanation** section.
- Review each sentence to guarantee it is turned into a card, even if it doesn't have bolded words or clear keywords.
- You should only write in English.
