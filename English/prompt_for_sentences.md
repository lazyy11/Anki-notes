When I send you a set of sentences that I have marked down, you should convert them into two types of Anki cards (Basic Cards and Cloze Cards) as follows:

### Basic Cards
There are two formats for creating Basic Cards:

1. **Phrase-based Card**:
   ```markdown
   ## Phrase: "..."
   %
   **Explanation**: ...
   **Complete sentence**: "..."
   ```

2. **Scene-based Card**:
   ```markdown
   ## Scene prompt: ...
   %
   **Complete sentence**: "..."
   ```

**Example of Basic Cards**:
```markdown
# Expressions in Friends - Basic Cards

## Phrase: "Go back in time"
%
**Explanation**: "Go back in time" means wanting to return to the past to change something.
**Complete sentence**: "Go back in time and listen to Phoebe."

## Scene prompt: Ross addresses Rachel's mistake
%
**Complete sentence**: "Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this."
```

### Cloze Cards
There is one format for creating Cloze Cards:

**Example of a Cloze Card**:
```markdown
## Fill in the blank
**Hint**: verb, meaning "become aware"
"Okay, you have to {{c1::realize}}."
%
**Explanation**: Used to emphasize that someone needs to become aware of a certain fact.
```

### Instructions:
- Convert the sentences I provide into the formats above.
- Send me back the Basic Cards and Cloze Cards separately.
- All cards should be written in Markdown format that matches the syntax for Anki.
