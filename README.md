# Anki Notes

The notes are organized into different categories and formats to support multiple learning styles, including:
- **Basic Cards**: Simple question-and-answer flashcards for straightforward recall.
- **Cloze Cards**: Fill-in-the-blank flashcards that hide key information in a sentence or context to encourage deeper recall.
- **Example Sentences**: Contextual notes that use example sentences from sources like TV shows or books to illustrate vocabulary and grammar usage.
- **Learning Techniques**: Personal notes on methods and best practices for creating and reviewing flashcards in Anki.

## Features
- **Well-organized content** for easy navigation.
- **Notes based on real-life examples** to enhance understanding and retention.
